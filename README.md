## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Google Apps Script environment not detected"**
- This message appears when running locally or outside Google Apps Script
- The system requires Google Apps Script environment to function

**"Tool not found" errors**
- Verify the Tool No. matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check for leading/trailing spaces
- Ensure the tool exists in the inventory

**Data not loading**
- Check Google Apps Script permissions
- Verify the SPREADSHEET_ID is correct
- Ensure the Google Sheet is accessible

**Form submissions not working**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Google Apps Script deployment is active
- Check internet connection


## Security Considerations

- The system requires Google Account authentication
- Spreadsheet access is controlled by Google Sheets permissions
- Deploy with appropriate access restrictions ("Anyone with Google account" vs. organization-only)
- Consider data sensitivity when setting sharing permissions
